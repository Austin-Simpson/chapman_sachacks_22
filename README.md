Inspiration
We can never decide what to eat in our own friend groups, so we wanted to solve the issue of where to eat with practical options.

What it does
Provides a poll on what everyone wants to eat and then sends the top-voted choice. Once done, YelpBot provides three different restaurants on the Yelp website near the chosen location in that food genre.

How we built it
We built our discord bot using both the Yelp API, Discord API, and Python

Challenges we ran into
Some issues consisted of problems interfacing with the API, getting the API keys working, making the polls detect reactions, and counting which reaction had the most votes

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of solving all of the challenges that we ran into as well as completing a huge project like this within a short time frame.

What we learned
We learned what skills were required when making a Discord bot and how to develop a poll bot to reach a website's API

What's next for Easy Outing
We can add more discord commands such as a !random command for when people really can't decide where to eat. We also can add more options of food and sort them based on proximity, reviews, and filtered price ranges.
